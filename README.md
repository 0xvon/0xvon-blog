# 0xvon blog

This repository contains a simple blog site example built with Next.js and TypeScript. It features a dark theme and displays articles written as Markdown files stored in a local folder.
This code is generated by GPT-4.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.

```bash
$ git clone ...
$ cd 0xvon-blog
$ npm i
```

2. Start the development server.

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, access http://localhost:3000 in your browser to ensure the blog site is functioning properly.

## Adding a New Post

1. Create a new Markdown file in the posts directory. Use a descriptive name with alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-) for the file name, as it will be part of the URL (e.g., my-first-post.md).
2. Add metadata (title and date) to the Markdown file. At the beginning of the file, include a YAML front matter section like this:

```md
---
title: 'Post Title'
date: '2023-03-28'
---
```

3. Write the content of the article in Markdown format below the front matter.
4. If the development server is running, the new article will be automatically added when you refresh your browser. If the server is stopped, start the development server again with npm run dev.

## Deployment

This project can be deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Follow the [official Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for a detailed guide on how to deploy your blog site.

## Updating an Existing Post

2. Edit the content or metadata (title and date) as needed.
3. Save the changes.
4. If the development server is running, the updated article will be automatically reflected when you refresh your browser. If the server is stopped, start the development server again with npm run dev.
