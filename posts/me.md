Hello. I'm 0xvon, an inventor on the internet space.
I love thinking system architecture and infrastructure, especially distributed ones.

<br>

## Current Works
- Board Dev Team at [Ethereum Japan](https://twitter.com/Ethereum_JP), spreads Ethereum Ecosystem in Japan through hosting events
- Researcher at [BGIN](https://bgin-global.org/), builds academic research reports about "Selective Disclosure on Verifiable Credentials" with professors, builders and regulators
- Student Master CS at Sako Lab in Waseda University, researches in Cryptography and Blockchain (from Sep. 2023)
- My main interests are:
    - **Distributed Computing**, which is a calculation method in which individual parts of a program are executed on multiple computers in parallel, each communicating with each other over a network, and processing proceeds as a whole.
    - **Verifiable Computing**, which is a method which enables a computer to offload the computation of some function, to other untrusted clients, while maintaining verifiable results.
