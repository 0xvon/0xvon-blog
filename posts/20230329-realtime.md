## Introduction

Today, processing performance in program execution has become extremely important. There are many factors to consider, such as how fast the processing speed is, how much latency there is, and what to do in case of failure.

This is also crucial in the world of blockchain. TPS (Transactions Per Second) and latency are commonly used as indicators of blockchain performance. Furthermore, the extent to which these metrics are maintained depending on the number of Validators and Clients is considered important for demonstrating scalability.

Herein lies a dilemma with security. Consider cryptographic theory, for example.

In the case of RSA cryptography, public and private keys are generated based on a number obtained by multiplying prime numbers p and q.

```javascript
const p = 420214234334588343
cost q = 4198423985725777

const modulus = p * q
const phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
const e = 65537
const d = e % phi

const privateKey = {n, e, d, p, q}
const publicKey = {n, e}
```

In order for this encryption to be secure, p and q must be very large prime numbers. This would make it extremely time-consuming to determine p and q based on the publicKey, and there would also be hundreds of millions of possible combinations of p and q. This is the basis of the encryption's security. While it might be tempting to think that the larger p and q are, the better, that's not necessarily the case. This is because the amount of computation required for encryption also increases significantly. In other words, cryptography is a trade-off between computational complexity and security, which is considered to be almost unbreakable in the future.

As a result, with emerging cryptographic techniques like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkp) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) that are gaining attention today, the demand is for "cryptographic algorithms that maximize security without compromising performance."

## Acyncronous World

Numerous researchers are investigating the concept of the "ultimate cipher," and it's interesting to consider whether it can be resolved in the asynchronous world. What kind of world is the asynchronous world?

"Quantum mechanics" and "the many-worlds interpretation" serve as the starting point for this idea.

Under the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, quantum particles exist as superpositions of multiple states. For example, if I were a quantum particle, there might be a 30% probability that I would be in India in one second and a 70% probability that I would be in Japan. The many-worlds interpretation suggests that until I am observed one second later, both the "world where I am in India" and the "world where I am in Japan" exist as parallel worlds, branching out together. The world converges once I actually go to India.

Can this be represented in the world of computers? Async/await waits for the result to return. Can we calculate the probability of each result and execute the subsequent processes in advance?

For example, in the RSA encryption algorithm mentioned earlier, modulus and phi are calculated asynchronously, and based on the result probabilities, phi, e, and d are calculated and returned in advance.

Of course, there are concerns. To achieve consistent results, quantum computing using principles from quantum mechanics is necessary. However, current quantum computing technology is still in development and is not capable of handling all tasks. There is still a long way to go to realize this concept.

This idea is somewhat similar to the optimisticRollup. In optRollup, transactions are executed first, and then validators can be filed later to cancel the execution.

In this idea, multiple possibilities are stored as execution results, and when the execution catches up, they are finalized.


## Post Acyncronous World

If the Asynchronous World is realized, it can bring the concept of "real-time processing" infinitely close to zero.

In money transfer transactions, even if a computer does not process transaction requests immediately and instead executes them during idle time, clients can still send money in real-time.

This could become a paradigm for encryption and distributed computing.

## Reaction Needed

Of course, there are several papers on this idea, but they are located elsewhere. 

Instead, I would like to hear your insights, criticisms, and further ideas about this concept.
